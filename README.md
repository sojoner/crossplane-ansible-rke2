# RKE2 Kubernetes Cluster Deployment with Ansible

This repository contains Ansible playbooks for automating the deployment and management of an RKE2 Kubernetes cluster. The playbooks handle both server and agent node setup, along with basic cluster configuration including storage class setup.

## Features

- Automated RKE2 server and agent installation
- Configurable node token management
- Local Path Provisioner setup as default storage class
- Automatic kubectl configuration
- Clean uninstallation process

## How It Works

The playbooks are organized into three main files:

1. `main.yaml`: Entry point that conditionally includes create or delete tasks based on the desired state
2. `create-rke2.yaml`: Handles the installation and configuration of RKE2 cluster
3. `delete-rke2.yaml`: Manages the clean uninstallation of RKE2

### Key Operations

The installation process:
- Creates necessary configuration directories
- Installs RKE2 server on the designated control plane node
- Configures server with TLS settings and token
- Installs and configures RKE2 agents on worker nodes
- Sets up Local Path Provisioner as the default storage class
- Configures kubectl and KUBECONFIG for cluster management

The uninstallation process:
- Attempts to use the RKE2 uninstall script if available
- Falls back to manual cleanup if needed
- Removes all RKE2-related files, directories, and configurations

## Requirements

- Ansible control node
- Target nodes with:
  - Systemd
  - Python 3
  - Sufficient privileges for system operations (sudo access)

## Variables Required

- `rke2_version`: Version of RKE2 to install
- `server_node`: Hostname of the designated server node
- `agent_nodes`: List of hostnames for agent nodes
- `rke2_token`: Cluster token (optional, will be generated if not provided)
